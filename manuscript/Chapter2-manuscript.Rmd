# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Predator hunting mode plays a crucial role in structuring ecological communities and ecosystems [@hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981; @preisserPredatorHuntingMode2007; @schmitzEffectsPredatorHunting2008; @romeroContrastingCascadeEffects2011; @kersch-beckerCommunitywideResponsesPredation2018]. Experimental studies in the field show that contrasting hunting modes, such as active hunting vs sit-and-wait, can cause opposing trophic cascades and act at different trophic levels [@schmitzEffectsPredatorHunting2008]. For instance, predators may differ in the amount of individuals, species, or in the type of prey they capture relative to their hunting mode [@donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @glaudasForagingModeRelative2019; @millerFearMovePredator2014]. Predator hunting modes are classified in three categories: 1) Active/patrolling hunters who usually search, follow, and chase prey in long distances, 2) sit-and-pursue hunters who remain motionless and pounce on prey that are within chasing distance, and 3) sit-and-wait (ambush) hunters who wait for prey to be within immediate capture distance [@mclaughlinSearchModesBirds1989]. There has recently been a growing interest in investigating how ecological factors shape individual variation in hunting behaviour within populations, and its consequences for predator-prey interactions [@pettorelliChapterTwoIndividual2015; @toscanoPersonalityForagingBehavior2016; @schmitzPredatorPreyFunctional2017]. Experimental evidence show that individual predator behavioural type can mediate consumptive and nonconsumptive effects in trophic interactions [@preisserPredatorHuntingMode2007; @griffenRoleIndividualBehavior2012; @toscanoTraitmediatedFunctionalResponses2014]. However, empirical studies still tend to classify predator species either as active or sit-and-wait hunters based on their average behaviour [@bolnickWhyIntraspecificTrait2011; @pettorelliChapterTwoIndividual2015; @schmitzPredatorPreyFunctional2017]. Thus, accounting for individual variation in hunting mode is a pressing need if we aim to understand the community consequences of predation.

Individual variation in hunting mode can be driven by specialisation when predators in a given population display consistent differences in their tactic use. Such differences are expected when individuals experience temporal and/or spatial fluctuations in the distribution, the availability, or the behaviour of their prey [@araujoEcologicalCausesIndividual2011; @carneiroMethodsDetectingQuantifying2017; @courbinShorttermPreyField2018; @phillipsCausesConsequencesIndividual2017]. For example, prey activity/mobility level is an important mediator of encounter rates with predators [@gerritsenEncounterProbabilitiesCommunity1977; @hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981; @scharfEfficiencyEvaluationTwo2006]. Hence, predators may specialise by using specific hunting modes to meet the energy/time required to successfully capture the type of prey they encounter. According to the locomotor-crossover hypothesis [@hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981], ambush predators should be more sucessful when they hunt fast-moving prey, while active predators should have greater success with sedentary prey [@belgradPredatorPreyInteractions2016; @donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @scharfEfficiencyEvaluationTwo2006]. If the individuals' tactics allows them to reach similar capture rates, then predators with contrasting hunting modes may coexist within the same population [@koblerCoexistenceBehaviouralTypes2009; @michelDifferentialEffectsStructural2009; @changPredatorPersonalityPrey2017].
