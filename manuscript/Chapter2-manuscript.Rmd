# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Predator hunting mode plays a crucial role in structuring ecological communities and ecosystems [@hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981; @preisserPredatorHuntingMode2007; @schmitzEffectsPredatorHunting2008; @kersch-beckerCommunitywideResponsesPredation2018], and usually consists of three main classes: 1) active/cursioral hunters who search, follow, and chase prey for long distances, 2) sit-and-pursue hunters who remain motionless and pounce on prey that are within chasing distance, and 3) sit-and-wait/ambush hunters who wait for prey to be within immediate capture distance [@mclaughlinSearchModesBirds1989]. Field studies show that predators with contrasting hunting modes (e.g. cursorial vs ambush) can cause opposing trophic cascades and act at different trophic levels [@schmitzEffectsPredatorHunting2008; @romeroContrastingCascadeEffects2011]. For instance, predators might differ in the number of individuals or species, or in the type of prey that they capture relative to their hunting mode [@donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @glaudasForagingModeRelative2019; @millerFearMovePredator2014]. Such observations sparked a growing interest in investigating how ecological factors shape individual variation in hunting behaviour within populations, and its consequences for predator-prey interactions [@pettorelliChapterTwoIndividual2015; @toscanoPersonalityForagingBehavior2016; @schmitzPredatorPreyFunctional2017]. Indeed, studies report that individual predator behavioural type can mediate consumptive and nonconsumptive effects during trophic interactions [@Smith.Blumstein2010; @griffenRoleIndividualBehavior2012; @toscanoTraitmediatedFunctionalResponses2014]. However, predator species still tend to be classified either as active or sit-and-wait hunters based on their average behaviour [@limaPuttingPredatorsBack2002; @Miles.etal2007; @pettorelliChapterTwoIndividual2015; @schmitzPredatorPreyFunctional2017]. It is therefore imperative that we account for individual variation in hunting mode during predator-prey interactions if we hope to understand community-level consequences of predation.

Individual variation in hunting mode can be driven by specialisation when predators in a given population display consistent differences in tactic use. Such differences are expected when individuals experience temporal and/or spatial fluctuations in the distribution, availability, or behaviour of their prey [@araujoEcologicalCausesIndividual2011; @carneiroMethodsDetectingQuantifying2017; @courbinShorttermPreyField2018; @phillipsCausesConsequencesIndividual2017]. For example, predators specialise in specific tactics to meet the energy/time demands that are required to successfully capture the type of prey generally encountered [@bowenPreydependentForagingTactics2002; @tinkerFoodLimitationLeads2008; @arthurSouthWinterWithindive2016]. Prey activity/mobility is an important trait influencing encounter rates with predators [@gerritsenEncounterProbabilitiesCommunity1977; @hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981; @scharfEfficiencyEvaluationTwo2006]. Therefore, individual variation in encounter rates with prey activity-types may lead to nonrandom interactions between predator-prey behavioural types [@wolfAnimalPersonalitiesConsequences2012]. Such a mechanism in trophic interactions is described by the locomotor-crossover hypothesis [@hueyEcologicalConsequencesForaging1981], which predicts that ambush predators should be more successful when they hunt fast-moving prey, while cursorial predators should have greater success with sedentary prey [@belgradPredatorPreyInteractions2016; @donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @scharfEfficiencyEvaluationTwo2006]. Individual predators with contrasting hunting modes might thus coexist within a population if their tactics allow them to reach similar capture rates [@koblerCoexistenceBehaviouralTypes2009; @michelDifferentialEffectsStructural2009; @changPredatorPersonalityPrey2017]. However, if researchers aim to generalise mechanisms of functional relationships between predators and prey, the environmental/ecological context needs to be taken into account [@Michalko.Pekar2016]. This may sometimes prove to be difficult to do in wild populations of free-ranging animals.

Habitat structure is a second important driver of individual differences in predator foraging mode, as it shapes opportunities for prey encounter and prey capture [@donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @jamesEffectsHabitatComplexity1994; @robinsonForagingBehaviorForest1982; @sargeantCanEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2007; @wasiolkaBehaviouralResponsesLizard2009]. A growing body of evidence points to predators who hunt in open and homogeneous habitats adopting a cursorial strategy, contrary to those hunting in heterogeneous and closed habitats that typically ambush their prey [@donihueAegeanWallLizards2016; @jamesEffectsHabitatComplexity1994; @wasiolkaBehaviouralResponsesLizard2009]. Hence, the habitat components of a predator's hunting grounds can predict the tactic used. Heterogeneous habitats are expected to favor sit-and-wait/sit-and-pursue hunters as they offer perches and cover, which are useful for ambushes [@jamesEffectsHabitatComplexity1994; @laurelInfluenceCruisingAmbush2006]. On the contrary, active hunters should benefit from higher encounter rates in open habitats as prey detection is easier, but, at the expense of being themselves more easily detected [@michelDifferentialEffectsStructural2009]. This suggests that tradeoffs could mediate individual differences in hunting strategies as a function of habitat structure. In this sense, predators could benefit from adjusting their strategy in accordance with short-term prey and habitat changes.

A wide range of predator taxa display flexible hunting behaviour [@helfmanModeSelectionMode1990; @heithausFeedingStrategiesTactics2018]. Foraging mode-switching occurs when individual predators respond to prey or habitat changes within their lifetime to maintain optimal hunting success. Notably, foraging mode switching can be triggered as a function of prey density [@inoueForagingStrategyMantid1983], prey behavioural type [@mcgheeReciprocalBehavioralPlasticity2013], prey condition [@wignallAlternativePredatoryTactics2008], seasonality [@Miles.etal2007; @phillipsCausesConsequencesIndividual2017], or in response to changes in habitat structure [@wasiolkaBehaviouralResponsesLizard2009]. Despite our improved knowledge of what triggers foraging mode-switching, most research is conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, which can fail to capture the nuances and complexities of predator species’ ecology in the wild [@Carter.etal2013; @Niemela.Dingemanse2014]. Understanding how and when predators balance specialisation vs switching in tactics, and how these changes affect hunting success would help scientists to predict more precisely the community consequences of predation.

Empirically investigating individual variation in hunting mode requires repeated measures of behaviour of numerous individuals under different environmental settings [@Dall.Griffith2014; @dingemanseCriteriaAcceptableStudies2020]. Such an approach may impose considerable financial, technical, and ethical challenges when studying larger or elusive wildlife, such as apex predators [@hertelGuideStudyingAmongindividual2020]. An additional challenge in empirical studies of predator-prey interactions is identifying traits in predators and prey that are easily observable, but also ecologically relevant. For instance, foraging mode is expected to vary along a continuum of morphological, physiological, and behavioural traits [@perryForagingModeLacertid1990; @perryEvolutionSearchModes1999; @butlerForagingModeChameleon2005; @cooperForagingModeControversy2005; @Miles.etal2007], but few studies have investigated how habitat- and prey-specific caracteristics jointly shape correlated foraging traits at different hierarchical levels.

Here, we propose a novel approach to combat the challenges of studying individual variation in predator behaviour that capitalizes on online multiplayer videogames [@ahmadProblemPredictingReal2014; @balicerModelingInfectiousDiseases2007; @lofgrenUntappedPotentialVirtual2007; @oultramVirtualPlaguesRealworld2013; @rossVirtualWorldsLaboratories2015]. Online multiplayer videogames could provide numerous opportunities for ecologists to study general ecological phenomena, including the mechanisms driving individual variation in behaviour [@Barbe.etal2020]. First, online videogames provide innumerable repeated measurements from millions of individual players across temporal and environmental gradients, which would be impossible with traditional field studies. Second, environmental settings are known and can be manipulated by the observer, thus permitting experimental tests of how specific environmental components shape the behaviour of interest. Third, videogames can realistically reproduce ecological settings in which complex among-individual interactions occur. A classic example of this approach is the analysis of the "Corrupted Blood" epidemic in *World of Warcraft*, where precise epidemiological parameters, such as transmission rate, were used to predict the outbreaks [@balicerModelingInfectiousDiseases2007; @lofgrenUntappedPotentialVirtual2007]. In this sense, online multiplayer videogames potentially constitute a complement to traditional field studies. We suggest that they will permit ecologists (among other scientists) to bridge the gap between real-world ecological studies and large-scale computer simulations. Online videogames are of interest to social, economic, and epidemiological sciences [@rossVirtualWorldsLaboratories2015], but to our knowledge, ours is the second study (see Cere et al., accepted) to use an online videogame to test ecological hypotheses.

We used the online multiplayer videogame *Dead by Daylight* (*DBD*) as our study system. This game pits a single player (predator) against a group of four players (prey), where the predator’s objective is to capture prey (Fig. 1). The predator's main objective is to search for and consume prey, while the preys' objective is to escape the predator. Prey can use a wide range of behaviours such as cooperation or hiding to successfully escape (Fig. 1 B-C). For example, they can cooperate to help conspecifics escape from capture (Cere et al., accepted), which predators may exploit to lure them in an ambush. These situations offer the possibility for predators to express different hunting tactics. Moreover, each match in *DBD* occurs within a specific game environment. The different game environments vary from forests, to farmlands, to urban areas. These environments differ in the heterogeneity and complexity of their structures [@mccoyHabitatStructureEvolution1991], such as in the availability of perches and refugia, vegetation density, or surface area (Fig 1. D). Hence, predators may encounter prey that express different behaviours, and are expected to benefit from changing their behaviour accordingly to maximize hunting success.

<br/>

In this study, we used an extensive and complete dataset on the hunting behaviour of predator players in *Dead by Daylight* to investigate environmental and individual variation in hunting mode, and how it affects hunting success. We used four hunting-related behaviours as proxies of hunting mode: travel speed, the rate of space covered in the environment, the proportion of time spent in an ambush position, and the time elapsed before the first prey capture. We applied the conceptual framework of behavioural syndrome analysis, which provides a means to quantify variation in multiple behaviours and their correlations at different hierarchical levels [@dingemanseQuantifyingIndividualVariation2013]. Thus, we quantified within-population structure/variability of predator foraging mode along a continuum of hunting traits [@perryForagingModeLacertid1990; @perryEvolutionSearchModes1999; @cooperForagingModeControversy2005; @butlerForagingModeChameleon2005; @Miles.etal2007]. Within-population variation inclues a) among-environment differences in average hunting behaviour, b) variation in tactic use arising when some individuals use one tactic more often than the others (i.e. individual specialisation), and c) the variation arising from individuals adjusting tactic use over time in response to changes in environmental conditions or prey behaviour (i.e. individual flexibility). First, we hypothesized that predators would use hunting tactics according to habitat-specific characteristics. Therefore, we expected correlated trait values associated with ambush tactics in smaller and heterogeneous environments, and correlated trait values associated with cursorial tactics in open/wider and homogeneous environments. Second, we hypothesized that individual predators would consistently differ in their hunting mode over time, with some specialising as cursorial hunters, and others as ambush hunters. Thus, we predicted that individual predators would differ in their average trait values along a continuum for all combinations of the four hunting traits (among-individual behavioural correlations). Following the locomotor-crossover hypothesis, we predicted that ambush and cursorial predator-types may coexist in the population, because both achieve similar hunting success by performing better against prey with the opposite locomotor tendency. Lastly, we hypothesized that individual predators would express flexible hunting behaviour, by switching from cursorial to ambush tactics between foraging bouts. We predicted that the individuals' residual trait values in contrasting hunting behaviours (ambush vs cursorial) would be negatively correlated (within-individual behavioural correlations).


# Materials and methods

## (a) Study system

The datasets used to test our hypotheses were provided by Behaviour Interactive Inc., the creator and administrator of *DBD*. The company records the behaviour of players for every match played online. During our study period, *DBD* offered 15 playable predator avatars. Players who incarnate the predator choose their avatar before a match takes place. Each predator avatar has unique abilities that may encourage different playstyles. Some have abilities than make them stealthier, while others can run faster, or have more powerful attacks. We thus controlled for the chosen avatar in our models since it may impact the playstyle of the predator player. In addition, the game environment where players compete is usually randomly assigned from a list of 27 maps differing in their physical components. For example, some maps have large playable surface areas with low vegetation density, which may favor the use of a cursorial strategy. Other maps have a smaller surface area with high vegetation density, which may impair visibility and alter prey detection, favoring the use of an ambush strategy. For additional details on the game settings and map characteristics, refer to https://deadbydaylight.com/en, and https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki.

## (b) Data collection

The study period ranged from March 20 to June 17 2019. Our population consisted of 2 171 new anonymous players who initiated their first match between March 20 and March 22, with a total record of 70 831 matches (average: 177 matches, range: 1 - 972 matches). Matches lasted for an average of 11 minutes (range: 5 - 58 minutes). For each match, we recorded the date (date-hour-minutes), the duration, the predator player’s anonymous ID, the prey players’ anonymous ID’s, the predator’s avatar, and the game environment where the match took place. We also recorded predator and prey behaviour (see next section ‘Behavioural traits’). We retained matches that lasted more than 5 minutes (short matches are usually interrupted because of technical issues). Players also score points during a match by performing different actions. To control for matches where players did not play, or for errors in the data collection, we removed matches where predators earned less than 1 point.

## (c) Behavioural traits

### (i)	Predator hunting behaviour

We selected four out of eight behavioural variables that summarize most of the variation in predator hunting tactics based on a principal component analysis (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in Supporting information for details on this analysis):  travel speed (meter/sec.), the rate of space covered (square/sec), the proportion of time spent in an ambush position during the match, and the proportion of time the predator took to capture his first prey during the match (see section ‘Behavioural traits measurements’ in the Supporting information for details).

### (ii)	Prey behaviour

We quantified the travel speed (meter/sec.) of prey and their rate of space covered (square/sec.). These two traits were measured using the same method described for predators (refer to Supporting information). For both traits, we averaged the four individual prey values within each match since we were interested in the average effect of prey behaviour on the predator’s hunting behaviour. Thus, we used one average value per prey trait, for each match played.

## (d) Statistical analyses

We performed all statistical analyses using the R software (version 4.0.2, R Core Team, 2020) on a remote computer cluster (Cedar, Compute Canada, https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar) running on CentOS Linux 7. All models were fitted using the R package "brms" version 2.14.4 [@burknerBrmsPackageBayesian2017].

### (i)	Variation in hunting mode

We first parametrized a multivariate Bayesian mixed model to quantify adjusted repeatability of hunting behaviour, and evaluate among-environment, among-individual (specialisation), and within-individual (flexibility) behavioural correlations. We included the predator’s population-response to prey behaviour by adding prey travel speed and rate of space covered as linear fixed effects. We square-root transformed the four hunting behaviours ($y1$ = speed, $y2$ = space, $y3$ = time in ambush, $y4$ = time 1^st^ capture) to achieve normality and then defined each as having a Gaussian distribution. All traits were then standardised to mean and unit variance (z-scores). The model was parametrized as (see section ‘Parametrisation of the multivariate mixed model’ in the Supporting information for details):

$$
\begin{aligned}
y1_{ij} = \beta_{0y1} + \beta_{1y1}\text{prey speed} + \beta_{2y1}\text{prey space} + id_{0y1,i} + env_{0y1,i} + avatar_{0y1,i} + \varepsilon_{0y1,ij} \\
y2_{ij} = \beta_{0y2} + \beta_{1y2}\text{prey speed} + \beta_{2y2}\text{prey space} + id_{0y2,i} + env_{0y2,i} + avatar_{0y2,i} + \varepsilon_{0y2,ij} \\
y3_{ij} = \beta_{0y3} + \beta_{1y3}\text{prey speed} + \beta_{2y3}\text{prey space} + id_{0y3,i} + env_{0y3,i} + avatar_{0y3,i} + \varepsilon_{0y3,ij} \\
y4_{ij} = \beta_{0y4} + \beta_{1y4}\text{prey speed} + \beta_{2y4}\text{prey space} + id_{0y4,i} + env_{0y4,i} + avatar_{0y4,i} + \varepsilon_{0y4,ij}
\end{aligned}
$$
where *i* indexes individual players and *j* the recorded match. Player ID ($id_{0y,i}$), the game environment ($env_{0y,i}$), the predator avatar ($avatar_{0y,i}$), and the residuals ($\varepsilon_{0y,i}$) are respectively random intercepts (among- individual, environment, and avatar variance) and residuals (within-individual variance) assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with their associated variance-covariance matrixes ($\Omega_{id}$, $\Omega_{env}$, $\Omega_{avatar}$, $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$) (refer to equations S1-S4 in Supporting information). We extracted among- individual, environment, avatar, and residual within-individual behavioural correlations from the variance-covariance matrixes by dividing the random effect covariances with the square root of the product of the random effect variances, for each combination of behaviours (according to equation 7c-d in Dingemanse & Dochtermann, 2013).

Following @nakagawaRepeatabilityGaussianNonGaussian2010, we calculated each hunting trait’s adjusted repeatability estimate (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) for the player ID, the game environment, and the predator avatar by dividing the variance associated with the random effect by the total phenotypic variance (ex. $ICC_{id0,y1} = V_{id0,y1} / (V_{id0,y1} + V_{env0,y1} + V_{avatar0,y1} + V_{\varepsilon0,y1})$). We computed the 95% credibility intervals for each repeatability estimate using the highest posterior density intervals.

### (ii) Effect of hunting behaviour and prey behaviour on prey capture

Since predators can capture a maximum of four prey, we used the number of prey captured on the total number of prey in a match (four) as a binomial response variable ($\omega_{ij}$ ~ $Binom(max_{ij}, P_{ij})$). We first quantified the linear relationship between hunting success and predator behaviour by fitting a binomial Bayesian generalized linear mixed model (glmm) with a logit link function. The model fits a linear function where we could estimate if hunting success increased or decreased with increasing hunting behaviour scores. We fitted the mean probability of capturing four prey ($P_{ij}$) for individual *i* on its *j* match as a function of its travel speed, rate of space covered, proportion of time spent in an ambush position, and proportion of time before the first capture. We computed a second model to account for variation explained by prey behaviour. The prey traits were travel speed and their rate of space covered (the terms of the second model have an "*"). We added random intercepts for the predator player’s ID ($id_{0,i}$) and the game environment ($env_{0,i}$). We could thus partition the variance in hunting success explained by differences among players and environments where matches occurred. We included an observation-level random effect to account for overdispersion [@harrisonComparisonObservationlevelRandom2015] and compared the models to a beta-binomial model to verify that the estimates were robust. Trait values were standardised to mean and unit variance (z-scores). The model(s) was fitted as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
logit (P_{ij}) &= (\beta_{0} + id_{0i} + env_{0i}) \\
&+ \beta_{1} \text{speed}_{i} \\
&+ \beta_{2} \text{space}_{i} \\
&+ \beta_{3} \text{time in ambush}_{i} \\
&+ \beta_{4} \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} \\
&+ \beta_{5} \text{prey speed}_{i}* \\
&+ \beta_{6} \text{prey space}_{i}* \\
&+ \varepsilon_{0,ij}
\end{aligned}
$$
where player ID and the game environment come from a normal distribution with estimated variance ($id_{0,i}$~$N(0, V_{id})$, $env_{0,i}$~$N(0,V_{env})$).

We built a third model within the same structure as the models above and included quadratic terms to determine whether the relationships between hunting success and predator/prey behaviours are concave or convex. Concave gradients suggest that individuals at the extremes of the trait distribution perform poorly while the opposite is true when the gradient is convex [@brodieVisualizingQuantifyingNatural1995]. We also added interaction terms for each combination of predator traits to estimate correlated effects on hunting success. Lastly, we included interaction terms between predator and prey behaviours to test if predators perform better against prey with the opposite locomotor tendency (locomotor crossover). All trait values were standardised to mean of 0 and unit variance (z-scores). The model had the following structure:

$$
\begin{aligned}
logit (P_{ij}) &= (\beta_{0} + id_{0i} + env_{0i}) \\
&+ \beta_{1,pred} \text{speed}_{i} + \beta_{2,pred} \text{space}_{i} + \beta_{3,pred} \text{time in ambush}_{i} + \beta_{4,pred} \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} \\
&+ \beta_{1,prey} \text{speed}_{i}^{'} + \beta_{2,prey} \text{space}_{i}^{'} \\
&+ \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{1,pred} \text{speed}_{i}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{2,pred} \text{space}_{i}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{3,pred} \text{time in ambush}_{i}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{4,pred} \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i}^{2} \\
&+ \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{5,prey} \text{speed}_{i}^{'2} + \frac{1}{2} \gamma_{6,prey} \text{space}_{i}^{'2} \\
&+ \gamma_{1,pred}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i} + \gamma_{2,pred}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{time in ambush}_{i} \\ 
&+ \gamma_{3,pred}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} + \gamma_{4,pred}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{time in ambush}_{i} \\
&+ \gamma_{5,pred}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} + \gamma_{6,pred}\text{time in ambush}_{i} \times \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} \\
&+ \gamma_{7,\textit{pred prey}}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'} + \gamma_{8,\text{pred prey}}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'} + \gamma_{9,\text{pred prey}}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'} \\
&+ \gamma_{10,\text{pred prey}}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'} + \gamma_{11,\text{pred prey}}\text{time in ambush}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'} \\
&+ \gamma_{12,\text{pred prey}}\text{time in ambush}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'} + \gamma_{13,\text{pred prey}}\text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'} \\
&+ \gamma_{14,\text{pred prey}}\text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'} \\
&+ \varepsilon_{0,ij}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{n,pred}$ are the quadratic terms for the predator traits ($x_{i}$), $\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{n,prey}$ are the quadratic terms for the prey traits ($x'_{i}$), $\gamma_{n,pred}$ are the interaction terms between predator behaviours, and $\gamma_{n, \text{pred prey}}$ are the interactions terms between predator and prey behaviours.

The reported estimates are partial coefficients which are the effect of the behaviour on hunting success while holding the other behaviours constant. We calculated the models’ ICCs following @nakagawaCoefficientDeterminationR22017. For each model parameter, we computed the 95% credibility intervals using the highest posterior density intervals. We assumed the fixed effects and the ICCs reached statistical significance when the 95% credibility intervals did not overlap zero [@Nakagawa.Cuthill2007].

# Results

## (a) Variation in hunting mode

### (i) Repeatability of hunting behaviour

As we predicted, we found moderate among-individual differences in average travel speed ($ICC_{id}$, average speed [95% CI] = 0.280 [0.254, 0.304]) and average proportion of time spent in ambush position ($ICC_{id}$, time in ambush [95% CI] = 0.322 [0.301, 0.342]), while individuals differed poorly in their time before the first capture ($ICC_{id}$, time 1^st^ capture [95% CI] = 0.102 [0.091, 0.114]) (Fig. 2A, diagonal). Individual predators differed weakly in their average rate of space covered ($ICC_{id}$, space covered [95% CI] = 0.051 [0.044, 0.057]) (Fig. 2A, diagonal).

Contrary to our predictions, predators did not differ in their average travel speed ($ICC_{env}$, average speed [95% CI] = 0.002 [0.001, 0.003]) and proportion of time spent in ambush position ($ICC_{env}$, time in ambush [95% CI] = 0.002 [0.001, 0.003]) under different game environments. However, we detected small differences among the game environments in the average rate of space covered and time before the first capture ($ICC_{env}$, space covered [95% CI] = 0.065 [0.036, 0.097]) ($ICC_{env}$, time 1^st^ capture [95% CI] = 0.055 [0.029, 0.082]) (Fig. 2B, diagonal). Finally, predators displayed small or weak differences among the predator avatars they played with for the four hunting behaviours ($ICC_{avatar}$, average speed [95% CI] = 0.091 [0.042, 0.153], $ICC_{avatar}$, space covered [95% CI] = 0.025 [0.010, 0.046], $ICC_{avatar}$, time in ambush [95% CI] = 0.034 [0.012, 0.064], $ICC_{avatar}$, time 1^st^ capture [95% CI] = 0.021 [0.008, 0.039]) (*Fig. SX in Supplementary material*).

### (ii) Correlations between hunting behaviours

As we expected, the predators’ average travel speed and proportion of time spent ambushing were negatively correlated ($r_{id_{0,y1}id_{0,y3}}$ [95% CI] = -0.635 [-0.671, -0.597]), thus, faster predators spent less time ambushing prey (Fig. 2A, lower off-diagonal). Faster individuals tended to cover space at a faster rate ($r_{id_{0,y1}id_{0,y2}}$ [95% CI] = 0.363 [0.297, 0.434]), and indivudals who were faster or covered space at a faster rate also tended to take less time to capture their first prey ($r_{id_{0,y1}id_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = -0.412 [-0.470, -0.350], $r_{id_{0,y2}id_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = -0.249 [-0.331, -0.163]) (Fig. 2A, lower off-diagonal). There was no relationship between space covered and time spent ambushing ($r_{id_{0,y2}id_{0,y3}}$ [95% CI] = 0.001 [-0.075, 0.079]), but ambush hunters tended to take more time to capture their first prey ($r_{id_{0,y3}id_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = 0.244 [0.177, 0.310]) (Fig. 2A, lower off-diagonal).

At the residual within-individual level, we detected a small positive correlation between travel speed and the rate of space covered ($r_{e_{0,y1}e_{0,y2}}$ [95% CI] = 0.191 [0.184, 0.198]) and a negative correlation between travel speed and the proportion of time spent ambushing prey ($r_{e_{0,y1}e_{0,y3}}$ [95% CI] = -0.289 [-0.296, -0.282]) (Fig. 2A, upper off-diagonal). Hence, matches in which a predator was faster were also matches in which he covered space at a faster rate, while spending less time ambushing prey, suggesting individual flexiblity in hunting mode. Predators who covered space at a faster rate also tended to take more time before capturing their first prey ($r_{e_{0,y2}e_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = 0.135 [0.127, 0.142]). We did not detect substantial correlations between travel speed or time ambushing and the time before the first capture ($r_{e_{0,y1}e_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = -0.080 [-0.088, -0.073], $r_{e_{0,y3}e_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = -0.097 [-0.105, -0.090]).

At the environment-level, predators who were faster in certain environments spent less time ambushing their prey ($r_{env_{0,y1}env_{0,y3}}$ [95% CI] = -0.465 [-0.767, -0.143]) (Fig. 2B, lower off-diagonal). This suggests that the environment could determine wether predators employ a cursorial or ambush tactic. We detected a similar relationship for space coverage and time ambushing, although not significant as the credibility interval overlapped zero ($r_{env_{0,y2}env_{0,y3}}$ [95% CI] = -0.246 [-0.582, 0.071]). Predators who covered space at a high rate in certain environments took less time to capture their first prey ($r_{env_{0,y2}env_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = -0.830 [-0.937, -0.702]), while those who used ambushes took more time to capture their first prey ($r_{env_{0,y3}env_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = 0.354 [0.025, 0.650]) (Fig. 2B, lower off-diagonal). Lastly, among-environment correlations between travel speed and space coverage, or between travel speed and the time before capturing a first prey were not significant ($r_{env_{0,y1}env_{0,y2}}$ [95% CI] = -0.045 [-0.404, 0.291], ($r_{env_{0,y1}env_{0,y4}}$ [95% CI] = 0.079 [-0.273, 0.419]) (Fig. 2B, lower off-diagonal).

## (b) Effect of predator and prey behaviour on prey capture

### (i) Linear relationships between predator/prey behaviour and predator hunting success

Predator behaviour alone explained x% of the variation in prey capture ($R_{marginal}^2$ = x). Travel speed ($\beta_{1} \text{speed}$ [95% CI] = 0.15 [0.13, 0.16]) and time spent ambushing ($\beta_{3} \text{time in ambush}$ [95% CI] = 0.41 [0.39, 0.42]) were positively related to prey capture, suggesting that faster predators and ambush predators captured more prey (Fig. 3A-C). Predators who covered space at a faster rate tended to capture fewer prey, nevertheless, the relationship was weak (Fig. 3B, $\beta_{2} \text{space}$ [95% CI] = -0.07 [-0.09, -0.05]) (Fig. 3B). Predators who took longer to capture their first prey had a significantly lower probability of capturing all four prey $\beta_{4} \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}$ [95% CI] = -0.49 [-0.51, -0.48] (Fig. 4D). Prey capture barely varied among game environments ($ICC_{env0}$ [95% CI] = 0.014 [0.007, 0.023]), while differences among individuals were low ($ICC_{id0}$ [95% CI] = 0.073 [0.066, 0.080]).

By adding prey behaviour, the model explained 18% of the variation in prey capture ($R_{marginal}^2$ = 0.181). Predators who competed against prey that were cursorial had a significantly lower probability of capturing all prey ($\beta_{5} \text{prey speed}$ [95% CI] = -0.20 [-0.22, -0.19]). Prey who were faster at covering space in the environment significantly reduced the probability of capturing all prey for the predator ($\beta_{6} \text{prey speed}$ [95% CI] = -0.63 [-0.65, -0.61]). All the model parameter values are reported in Table *SX* in Supporting information.

### (ii) Quadratic relationships between predator/prey behaviour and predator hunting success

The model that included quadratic and interaction terms did not significantly increase explained variance in prey capture ($R_{marginal}^2$ = 0.212). However, we observed significant concave relationships for travel speed ($\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{1,pred} \text{speed}^{2}$ [95% CI] = -0.12 [-0.13, -0.11]) and time in ambush ($\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{3,pred} \text{time in ambush}^{2}$ [95% CI] = -0.12 [-0.12, -0.11]) (Fig. 3E-G), suggesting that predators maximized hunting success around the behaviours' population averages. Prey capture was again not significantly affected by space covered (Fig. 2F) ($\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{2,pred} \text{space}^{2}$ [95% CI] = -0.02 [-0.03, -0.00]), and the shape of the quadratic function relating prey capture to time before the first prey is captured was almost the same as the linear function ($\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{4,pred} \text{time 1}^{st} \text{capture}^{2}$ [95% CI] = 0.07 [0.06, 0.08]) (Fig. 3H). Prey capture was still similar among game environments ($ICC_{env0}$ [95% CI] = 0.015 [0.007, 0.024]), and varied slightly among individual players ($ICC_{id0}$ [95% CI] = 0.080 [0.072, 0.087].

Prey capture by predators as a function of prey speed and prey rate of space covered was also described by concave relationships
($\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{5,prey} \text{speed}^{2}$ [95% CI] = -0.07 [-0.08, -0.07], $\frac{1}{2} \gamma_{6,prey} \text{space}^{2}$ [95% CI] = -0.10 [-0.11, -0.08]), thus, predators had a higher probability of capturing all prey during a match when they competed against prey who expressed average population values of these traits. All the quadratic model parameter values are reported in Table *SX* in Supporting information.

### (iii) Effect of the predator-prey behavioural interaction on predator hunting success

According to our predictions, predators who tended to be faster were more successful when they competed against sedentary prey ($\gamma_{8,\text{pred prey}}\text{speed}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'}$ [95% CI] = -0.09 [-0.11, -0.07]) (Fig. 4A). Predators had higher hunting success for the whole range of values of space covered when they competed against slower-moving prey ($\gamma_{9,\text{pred prey}}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'}$ [95% CI] = -0.05 [-0.06, -0.03]) (Fig. 4C). Contrary to our expectations, the most successful predators where those who covered space at a slow rate when they competed against prey that were slower at covering space in the environment ($\gamma_{10,\text{pred prey}}\text{space}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'}$ [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.07, 0.12]) (Fig. 4D). However, those who covered space at the fastest rate where more successful against prey that were the slowest at covering space (Fig. 4D). Lastly, for the whole range of time spent ambushing prey, predators had generally higher success against slower moving prey and prey that covered less space in the environment, although the interaction with prey space covered was not significant ($\gamma_{11,\text{pred prey}}\text{time in ambush}_{i} \times \text{speed}_{i}^{'}$ [95% CI] = -0.06 [-0.07, -0.04], $\gamma_{12,\text{pred prey}}\text{time in ambush}_{i} \times \text{space}_{i}^{'}$ [95% CI] = -0.01 [-0.03, 0.01]) (Fig 4E-F). All the interaction parameter values are reported in table *SX* in Supporting information.
