# videogame_hunting_tactics-Rscripts
R scripts used to produce the results in Fraser Franco et al. (in preparation)

**Note** : The model outputs were too large (~5Gb) for me to push them to the remote repository. I will gladly share the files to anyone who wishes to reproduce the results (plots and tables).
