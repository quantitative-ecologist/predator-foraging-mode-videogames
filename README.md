# videogame_hunting_tactics-Rscripts
R scripts used to produce the results in Fraser Franco et al. (in preparation)

All models were run on a remote computer cluster (Compute Canada). You can open the .sh files under the "jobs" folder to see the computer specifications used to run the models.

**Note** : The model outputs were too large (~5Gb) for me to push them to the remote repository. I will gladly share the files to anyone who wishes to reproduce the results (plots and tables).
