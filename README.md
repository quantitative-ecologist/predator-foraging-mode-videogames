# videogame_hunting_tactics-Rscripts
R scripts used to produce the results in Fraser Franco et al. (in preparation)

All models were run on a remote computer cluster (Cedar, Compute Canada, https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar). You can open the .sh files under the "jobs" folder to see the computer specifications used to run the models. The computer cluster runs on CentOS Linux 7.

**Note** : The model outputs were too large (~5Gb) for me to push them to this repository. I will gladly share the files to anyone who wishes to reproduce the results (plots and tables).
