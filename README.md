# Predator foraging mode in videogames

R scripts used to produce the results in "Studying predator foraging mode and hunting success at the individual level with an online videogame" (in preparation).

## Description

All models were run on a remote computer cluster (Cedar, Compute Canada, https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar). You can open the .sh files under the jobs/ folder to see the computer specifications used to run the models. The computer cluster runs on CentOS Linux 7.

## Coding Workflow

All the R scripts are enumerated. You can find in the "outputs" folder the specific outputs generated from the R scripts. Each output has a number that correponds to the R script used to generate it.

**Note** : The model outputs were too large (~5Gb) for me to push them to this repository. I will gladly share the files to anyone who wishes to reproduce the results (plots and tables).
